# Things I need to do

1. ~~get back from walking my dog~~
2. ~~continue this coding assessment~~
3. create a server to make requests
   1. Note:
       1. this is under the assumption that we do not want our OMDb API key leaked.
       2. because this repo will be public, I doubt this is a true concern.
4. make a form on the client side to submit requests to the backend
   1. add tests
   2. update styles
